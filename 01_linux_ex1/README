Kernel System Calls
-------------------

 The program whatIdo create a folder and in this folder it is create a file named gooLuck.
with permission 7-5-5.
once you run the file this is what you get in terminal :
There you go... tell me what I do...root@DESKTOP-VLLKEER:~/welcomeToDevOpsMay22#
once you run this file. it ask you what you want me to do?
i think it's calling the Kernel System Calls  and you can make folders ,files and delete and display files.





Broken Symlink
-------------------
When we created the file $FILENAME at first it was in the same folder as the file so the link was good.
and we show by using ls ( it is shown in green color).
once we move it to a different folder we broken the the soft link( it is show in red color).

the way we fix it:
to provide the full path in the command
for example:
command: ln -s /root/backups/$FILENAME backup.obj
in order to fix the link



Binary Numbers
--------------
1.
   111 = (1*2**2)+(1*2**1)+(1*2**0) = 7
   100 = (1*2**2)+(0*2**1)+(0*2**0) = 4
   10110 = (1*2**4)+(0*2**3)+(1*2**2)+(1*2**1)+(0*2**0) = 22

2. 8 bit = 255
 full 8 bit use - 11111111 =
 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 1*2^2 1*2^1 1*2^0 = 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255

3. 9 bits = 111111111 -255
   011001010 = (0) 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^1 = -202

4. in order represent a floating point numbers we need to separate the number before the floating point and divide by
 two  until we get 0
and then we deal with the number after the floating point and we multiply it by 2 until we get 0 again/
and then we can write it done
in the example you see

for example:
23.625  = 10111.101
__23__   .   ___0625___
23/2 1       0625*2=1.250  1
11/2 1       0.25*2  0
5/2  1       0.5 * 2  1
2/2  1        1
1    0
