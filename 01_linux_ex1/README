Kernel System Calls
-------------------
# The actions according to the "strace" command
#-------------------------------
# 1) Checks if a subfolder named "welcomeToDevOpsMay22" exits in currnet location.
# 2) Then if doesn't exits it creates it with permitions 700 (rwx owner only).
# 3) Creates the file welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck with permitions 666.
# 4) Then write the text "There you go... tell me what I do..." into the file.



Broken Symlink
-------------------
# The $FILENAME variable contain only with the file name itself,
# without its full path location.
# So in the command: "ln -s $FILENAME backup.obj"
# the current relative path is used so backup.obj is point OK when in the same folder.
# but when backup.obj changes its location so the file in its current location doesn't exist.
#
# the fix will be is to state the full current path in the ln command like this:
#    ln -s "$PWD/$FILENAME" backup.obj




Binary Numbers
--------------
# 1)   111 bin =  7 dec
#      100 bin =  4 dec
#    10110 bin = 22 dec
#
# 2) 8 bit binary that is: 8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1
#                          |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
#                          v    v    v    v    v    v    v    v
#                        128 + 64 + 32 + 16  + 8  + 4  + 2  + 1  = 255
#
#    So the decimal number range is 0 - 255
#
# 3) The first digit can represent a +/- sign value.
#    where the next 8 digits a value range 0-255.
#    so actually a number ranged -255 to +255 can be represented.
#
# 4) 1st 8 bit number will represent natural numbers,
#    And a 2nd 8 bit number, a decimal digits after the decimal dot.
