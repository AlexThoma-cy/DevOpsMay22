Kernel System Calls
-------------------
Strace logs all the system calls done by a program when it is run.
The calls and (arguments) are written in the left side, and after the = sign, we see the result of the call which is
marked by a number (0, 3, 68...), or a pointer to a memory address (like 0x7f9967a56000).


Binary Numbers
--------------
1.  111 binary = (2^0 * 1) + (2^1 * 1) + (2^2 * 1) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 decimal
    100 binary = (2^0 * 0) + (2^1 * 0) + (2^2 * 1) = 0 + 0 + 4 = 4 decimal
    10110 binary = (2^0 * 0) + (2^1 * 1) + (2^2 * 1) + (2^3 * 0) + (2^4 * 1) = 0 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 16 = 22 decimal
2. With 8 bits we can have a range of:
    00000000 binary = (2^0 * 0) + .... + (2^7 * 0) = 0 decimal
    11111111 binary = (2^0 * 1) + .... + (2^7 * 1) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255 decimal
3. We can decide that the left most bit will represent a negative number if set to 1, or a positive number if set to 0.
   example:
   0100 binary = (2^0 * 0) + (2^1 * 0) + (2^2 * 1) + (0 for positive) = 0 + 0 + 4 (positive) = 4 decimal
   1111 binary = (2^0 * 1) + (2^1 * 1) + (2^2 * 1) = 1 + 2 + 4 + (1 for negative) = 1 + 2 + 4 (negative) = -7 decimal
4. My suggestion is to divide the 8 bits to 2 groups of 4 bits. One group (lets say the left one in the example),
    will represent the numerator, and the other will represent the denominator,and thus we can create a fraction.
    example -
    0001/0100 binary = 1/4

Broken Symlink
-------------------
Symlinks does not track changes in file position. once the files were moved, the symlink broke and now it needs to
be recreated
