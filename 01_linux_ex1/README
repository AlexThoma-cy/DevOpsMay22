Kernel System Calls
-------------------n about it
 >
< if was to go one by one i can explain each one but.
 in general the task was to download through wget the files from the
 web give it permissions with chmod to be able to use strace
  and with the strace to gets information

  Broken Symlink
-------------------
<  the issues comes from the moving of the file
in order to fix the issue
remove the current the correct symlink with rm command
and create a new one with the right path.>



Binary Numbers
--------------
< first question-------
 a.111= 1x1 + 1x2 +1x4= 7
 b.100= 0x1 + 0x2+ 1x4 = 4
 c.10110= 0x1 + 1x2 + 1x4 + 0x8 + 1x16 = 2+4+16 = 22

second question ------

8 bits, can represent positive numbers from 0 to 255
11111111= 1x128+ 1x64 + 1x32 + 1x16 + 1x8 + 1x4 + 1x2 + 1x1 = 255
or
00000000= 0x128+ 0x64 + 0x32 + 0x16 + 0x8 + 0x4 + 0x2 + 0x1 = 0
that's the range between 8 bits numbers.

third question ----
you need to take the first number as +/- sign
1= minus
0= plus
so when you do that you left with 8 more bits and just pick a random number
between 0-255
1-01010101= -1x64 + -1x16 + -1x4+ -1x1 = -64 + -16 + -4 + -1= -85>
