Kernel System Calls
-------------------
The simplest explanation for what is happening in the code is that when I write a certain command in the terminal, a process of downloading a program file called "whatIdo" occurs.
 Since the file was downloaded from the cloud and not created by a local user or a user with administrative rights, the file cannot be run without certain permissions.
 When the file is given the necessary permissions to run, the following happens ...
 The program file creates a folder "welcomeToDevOpsMay22" with a text file inside called "goodLuck" which contains the text string "There you go... tell me what I do...".



Broken Symlink
-------------------
Fix for this one is simple, need to delete old backup file backup.obj and create a new symlink with full patch, not moving it to folder.
To fix the issue is:
ln -s ../$FILENAME backups/backup.obj



Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 7
          "4"     "2"     "1"

   100 = 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 4
          "4"     "0"     "0"

   10110 = 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 22
            "16"    "0"     "4"     "2"     "0"

2. Available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number is "256".
