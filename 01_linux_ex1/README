@FIXME you explained the stace command but you didn't supply a brief description of what the program does
Kernel System Calls
-------------------
The starce command traces all system calls made by the command.
For example: Errors, Open files and more.


Broken Symlink
-------------------
The previous symlink had been broken. (When changing file location of one of the files - it breaks the link between them).
First, we need to remove the previous link.
Next, we'll create a new one:
  ln -s $FILENAME backups/backup.obj


Binary Numbers
--------------
1) 
    111 = 1*2**2 + 1*2**1 + 1*2**0 = 7
    100 = 1*2**2 + 0*2**1 + 0*2**0 = 4
    10110 = 1*2**4 + 0*2**3 + 1*2**2 + 1*2**1 + 0*2**0 = 22
2)  
    a. 8 bit is a 255 decimal range.
    b. First bit will be the negative or positive symbol. 
       The rest (8) bits will represent the decimal number.
    c. 4 first bits will represent the numbers before the point.
       4 last bits will represent the numbers after the point.
