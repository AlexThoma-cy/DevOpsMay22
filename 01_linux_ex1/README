@FIXME Great work
Kernel System Calls
-------------------
Create directory ./welcomeToDevOpsMay22 (if does not already exists)
Open file goodLuck under welcomeToDevOpsMay22 (empty, for writing only with w/r permissions)
write to the file: "There you go... tell me what I d"


Broken Symlink
-------------------
the link is broken because the file moved and the file is linking to a file that does not exist.
A solution can be to re-link backups/backup.obj to backup file:

unlink backups/backup.obj
ln -s $FILENAME backups/backup.obj

Or move the backup files to backups directory.

Binary Numbers
--------------
1.
111=7
100=4
10110=22

2.available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number is 0-255

3.use the left bit to represent the sign (1-negative 0-positive)

4.IEEE 8bit format
Use decimal point, left to point will convert the int and the right to the point will convert the fraction.
1.turn int to binary,
2. convert fraction by multiplying by 2, if result is bigger than 1 generate 1, and multiply the remainder by 2. if below 1 generate 0 and continue multipying by 2.
take generated bits and place after int binary point.
move the decimal point to be 1 bit to the left.
4 bits to the right of the point put at the end of the number.
calculate exponent: bias=3 in 8 bit format, add number of times the point moved. convert to binary.
first bit - sign, 3 next bits - exponent, 4 next bits - rest of the bits after the point.
