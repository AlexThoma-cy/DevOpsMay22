@FIXME great work
Kernel System Calls
-------------------
An execve function is running the whatIdo fle.
A check is done if a folder named  "welcomeToDevOpsMay22" exists, and the output is no.
The program creates a folder " welcomeToDevOpsMay22"
A file is created in this folder and the name of the file is "goodLuck" with rw permissions to all(ugo).                                                                                                                                                  The program writes this sentence to the created file:  There you go …tell me what I Do …
 all(ugo).
The program writes this sentence to the created file:  There you go …tell me what I Do …


Broken Symlink
-------------------
The problem is that the path of the  the soft link has changed.
The fix is to change the command to: ln -s $FILENAME backups/backup.obj



Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111    binary = 1*2^0 +1*2^1 +1*2^2 =1+2+4=7
   100    binary = 0*2^0 +0*2^1 +1*2^2 =4
   10110  binary = 0*2^0 +1*2^1 +1*2^2 +0*2^3 +1*2^4 =0+2+4+0+16=22

2. 8 bit binary range number is 0-255.
   this is the sum of 11111111 8 bit binary bits in decimal base/

3. given 9 binary number ,the way I choose to represent a negative number is this way:
   the lefiest bit will represent the +/- sign where
    0 - represents +
    1 - represents -
    other 8 bit will represents the number itself.

4.  representing binary floating number with 8 binary bits:
    dividing the number to 2 parts of 4 bits each, the left part called mantisa (the number)
    and the right side called exponent.
    The left bit in every part represents the sign(+ or -) where
    0 - represents +
    1 - represents -
    if for example the exponent is +2 we will move the floating 2 bits to the right and than
    calculate the number and put  its sign.
