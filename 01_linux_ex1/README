111 = (1 × (2**2)) + (1 × (2**1)) + (1 × (2**0)) = 7
100 = (1 × (2**2)) + (0 × (2**1)) + (0 × (2**0)) = 4
10110 = (1 × (2**4)) + (0 × (2**3)) + (1 × (2**2)) + (1 × (2**1)) + (0 × (2**0)) = 22

the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number is 256

extra sign bit at MSB position is added to a regular binary number
bit 0 at MSB represents positive unmber
bit 1 at MSB represents negative unmber
4 = 0100    -4 = 1100
